            <ul>
                <li>Her nickname was Peg Leg.</li>
    <!--
        At only six years old, Frida contracted polio, the first of many diseases she faced throughout her life. Polio left an injury on her right foot and that’s why she got that nickname.
    -->
                <li>The artist was a polyglot.</li>
                <li>She had a car accident at 18 that prevented her from being a mother.</li>
    <!--
        She had a rupture in her spine, clavicle, and fractures to her pelvis, right leg, and shoulders. The accident was so severe that an injury to the uterus prevented her from being a mother. There were, in total, 35 operations. But she never gave up or stopped being stronger because of it, even when she had her right leg amputated in 1950

                <li>He wrote a note before he died.</li>
    <!--
        In 1954, Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderon was found dead inside her home. She was 47 years old. In her death certificate, the cause of death is pulmonary embolism, but to this day, it is not ruled out that she died of an overdose - since she used several medications. She left a note in her diary saying: “I hope the exit is joyful – I hope not to return.” This secret notebook, which contained several notes, became a book.
