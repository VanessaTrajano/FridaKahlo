                <p>
                    Frida Kahlo (1907-1954) was a Mexican painter known for her surrealist-inspired self-portraits and also for her photographs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a life marked by passion, pain, suffering and perseverance, Frida Kahlo brought to the world the vibrant colors and energy of the Mexican people in their clothes, props and paintings.

                <h2>Curiosities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Her nickname was Peg Leg.</li>
                    <p>
                        At only six years old, Frida contracted polio. Polio left an injury on her right foot and that is why she got that nickname.
                    </p>
                <li>The artist was a polyglot.</li>
                    <p>
                        She spoke Spanish, English, French and a little German and Russian.
                    </p>
                <li>She had a car accident at 18 that prevented her from being a mother.</li>
                    <p>
                        She had a rupture in her spine, clavicle, and fractures to her pelvis, right leg, and shoulders. But she never gave up or stopped being stronger because of it, even when she had her right leg amputated in 1950.
                    </p>
                    <li>She wrote a note before she died.</li>
                    <p>
                        She left a note in her diary saying: “I hope the exit is joyful – I hope not to return.”
